              By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products
              from Shop, the Customer agrees that it is bound by these Terms and
              Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via
              the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of
              the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon
              the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which will
              prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the
              contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary
              any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by
              the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied.
              Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the
              Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary
              the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both
              parties.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Any quotation by Shop to the Customer will be open for acceptance
              by the Customer within the period stated in the quotation or,
              where no period is stated, within seven (7) days from the date of
              the quotation. Thereafter, prices stated in the quotation may be
              varied by Shop without notice to the Customer.

            <h6 class="font-weight-bold my-4" id="prices">Prices / Taxes</h6>
            <p class="text-muted">
              The prices charged by and payable to Shop will be the ruling
              prices applicable at the time of order placement, provided that
              the Products are accepted for delivery within a reasonable time.
              Prices are subject to change without notice. Recommended retail
              prices are provided for indicative purposes only and there is no
              obligation for Shop to comply with that recommendation. It as
              agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to acquire the
              quantity of Products sold then without limiting Shop' other rights
              and remedies the unit price charged for the goods sold may be
              amended to take into account any variation in the total quantity
              purchased by the Customer. Prices include GST, but do not include
              any other tax or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to
              be paid by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.

            <h6 class="font-weight-bold my-4" id="terms">Terms of Payment</h6>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform
              the Customer if this is to be the case before processing the
              transaction.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not
              agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer,
              the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due for
              payment in cash prior to delivery.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted">
              Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to
              the Customer, the Customer must make payments in accordance with
              the payment terms provided by Shop.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Where Shop has approved the provision of a commercial credit
              arrangement with the Customer but has not provided notice of the
              payment terms to the Customer, the Customer must pay the total
              purchase price for Products supplied within seven days of the
              statement date.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Credit Card Payment at an Invoice or transaction level may also be
              offered to the Customer as a stand-alone payment method, or in
              conjunction with Credit Card Direct Debit Authorisation.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Any commercial credit arrangements that are provided to the
              Customer by Shop will continue until terminated by Shop at it sole
              discretion. In the event that Shop terminates the Customer's
              commercial credit arrangement, the Customer will be notified in
              writing and termination will take effect upon receipt of that
              notification by the Customer.
            </p>
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold my-4" id="change">Change of Ownership</h6>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information
              supplied and the representations made by the Customer. In the
              event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether
              total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide written
              notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop
              receives written notice from the Customer of a change in
              ownership, the Customer (including where it is a company or
              trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds Shop indemnified
              against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages,
              costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in
              trading with any person, company (including the same company but
              with a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity
              (including a trust) which may have purchased the Customer's
              business or any interest in the Customer's business or any of the
              shares in the Customer and used the Customer's previously approved
              account for trading.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments
              through Credit Card Direct Debit, the Customer must provide notice
              in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership
              of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact the new
              owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card information if
              applicable.

              The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be at
              Shop' discretion. Shop reserves the right to deliver Products in
              part deliveries. In the event that Shop incurs additional costs
              for meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory
              Deliveries) or urgent delivery arrangements, these additional
              costs may be charged to the Customer and may include the cost of
              airfreight where it is not the normal method of delivery. The
              Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold at any
              time during normal business hours.

              Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any
              late delivery of the Products and late delivery will not entitle
              the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for the
              Products.
